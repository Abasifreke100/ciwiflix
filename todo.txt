// Order Workflow 

1. user create order (done)
2. user complete payment for order (done)
3. get closest driver and assign to order 
4. driver can accept and reject order, if driver reject order get another driver and send order .
if driver accepts {
  update order with driver id 
  also send eta
}
5. calculate estimated delivery time 






i am working on a delivery app api. using nestjs and mongodb

 i have the order schema and user schema. the user/ driver schema has 
{
longititude: number
Latitude: number
}

While the order schema has 
{
  fromLongitude: number,
  fromLatitude: number
}

i want to query db to get all drivers close to the pickup location of the order using the longitude and latitude.
and then i'll send driver notification request to accept order, when driver accept order i want to update user with the eta and driver location . i am using websockets for real time communication
